# List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Python’s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

## 🧾 Program

```
L=[153,147,124,102] 
 
print(sum(L)))
```


## Output
<img width="542" height="205" alt="530396966-ad4e6416-b646-4a72-a95e-e63f7874f030" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02999d02-d8eb-45c2-8b6c-c6e3241ba70d" />

## Result

Thus, the program has been successfully executed.
